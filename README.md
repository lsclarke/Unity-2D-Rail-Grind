# Unity-2D-Rail-Grind

This repository contains a prototype rail grinding mechanic I took the time to develop, and as a former Unity Game Design Instructor I saw this as an opportunity to use my skills to help teach others like me who may also be very enthusiastic about implementing this feature in their projects. This is open source for everyone to use. Please feel free to give me feedback and thoughts on this project.
