# Unity-2D-Rail-Grind

This repository contains a prototype rail grinding mechanic I took the time to develop, and as a former Unity Game Design Instructor I saw this as an opportunity to use my skills to help teach others like me who may also be very enthusiastic about implementing this feature in their projects. This is open source for everyone to use. Be sure to implement the Spline Package from the package manager also please feel free to give me feedback and thoughts on this project.

Create a spline and add your prefab gameObject to the Spline Instantiate Script

Make sure when adding your prefab gameObject you have the settings of your Spline Instantiate to look like the image provided. This will ensure that your sprite/gameObject maintains the same view in game and isn't affected by the splines rotation. Make sure that your prefab object also has a box collider 2d and a rail layer your player can detect. This is creating multiple points on the spline for the player to detect and move along.
